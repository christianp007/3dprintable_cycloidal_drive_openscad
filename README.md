# 3dprintable_cycloidal_drive_openscad
 A 3d printable customizable cycloidal drive designed with OpenSCAD

Cycloidal drives can be used for a wide range of speed ratios, the default one is 10:1 but 60:1 and more is easily possible.

Image shows prototypes, the final part was printed in transparent taulman alloy 910 (nylon) and PCTPE (nylon+flexible TPE), which is hard to make fotos of.

Use the "SHOW_PART" Variable to create one piece at a time so its printable
The motor shaft cannot be attached later as its chamfered, so it must be printed together with the disc!
